# MyScore


An open-source software for avatar-based teaching and learning in virtual reality.
With MyScore, we enable students and lecturers to communicate, teach and learn with each other using avatars and to use a wide variety of teaching and learning scenarios.


In the context of the current pandemic, the limitations of face-to-face teaching, as well as those of hybrid approaches such as blended learning, have also become apparent at many German universities. 
The greatest disadvantage resulted from the location-dependency of these concepts. 
The widespread use of videoconferencing software and systems bridges the distances that the Corona crisis has put between teachers and students, but these approaches have their own limitations. 
The multi-faceted nature of face-to-face teaching cannot be fully represented by such applications, as the two-dimensionality of collaborative interaction cannot represent the true complexity and exchange in traditional teaching situations. 
Even outside the current global pandemic, especially with regard to international collaborations, the question arises as to what the future of digital teaching looks like and how it can promote exchange between learners and teachers even without presence.
